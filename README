Geeklog Plugin Toolkit 0.1.0                                        2009-03-15

The Plugin Toolkit will eventually grow into a set of tools to assist plugin
developers in creating and maintaining their plugins.

For now, there is only one tool available: The Plugin Generator.

Usage: The Plugin Generator has to be called from the command line. You need
the CLI version of PHP.

    cd plugin-toolkit
    php plgen.php

Follow the on-screen instructions. Default values are given in [square brackets]
and can be used by pressing enter. Otherwise, enter your value.

A plugin directory, using the name you entered, will be created in the current
directory. This is a fully usable plugin, although it doesn't exactly do much
yet. It does, however, perform install and uninstall and includes generic
public and admin pages. Filling in the functionality is your job ...

Note that currently, the created plugin is supposed to be used with Geeklog 1.6
which has not been released yet. You can download the current Geeklog
development version, following these instructions:
